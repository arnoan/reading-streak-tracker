# Note: This exclude pattern will match any Python file (*.py) under any migrations directory
# that is itself under the apps directory. We exclude the migration files, as they are managed by
# Django and developers don't usually actively make changes here. By default Django-generated
# migration files do not adhere to the 100 character limit (some lines are even 130+ characters).
