The word "Yari" is of Japanese origin and refers to a type of traditional Japanese spear. 
Yari were used by samurai and foot soldiers (Ashigaru).

In a symbolic sense, "Yari" can represent support or protection, 
as spears have been used historically to defend or support a group. 
Its single, sharp point could metaphorically signify focus.

Being a short and memorable word, 
"Yari" serves well as a name for a folder 
that is meant to contain supporting files 
and help maintain a sharp focus.
